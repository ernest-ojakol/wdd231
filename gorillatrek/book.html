                    <h2>1 Person Trek</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Exclusive Experience:</strong> Enjoy a private, one-on-one encounter with the gorillas, allowing for a
                            deeply personal and uninterrupted interaction.</li>
                        <li><strong>Customized Itinerary:</strong> Tailor your trek to your pace and interests, with the flexibility to spend
                            more time observing specific behaviors or taking photographs.</li>
                        <li><strong>Enhanced Safety:</strong> With just one trekker, your guide can focus entirely on your safety, ensuring a
                            more secure and attentive trekking experience.</li>
                        <li><strong>Premium Guide Attention:</strong> Receive undivided attention from your expert guide, who can provide
                            in-depth knowledge on gorilla behavior, conservation, and local flora and fauna.</li>
                        <li><strong>Lower Environmental Impact:</strong> A single person trek minimizes the impact on the gorilla habitat,
                            promoting conservation by reducing human presence.</li>
                        <li><strong>Intimate Photography Opportunities:</strong> Capture unique, unobstructed photos and videos without other
                            trekkers in the frame, enhancing your photography portfolio or personal memories.</li>
                        <li><strong>Quiet Observation:</strong> The absence of group noise allows for a quieter trek, potentially leading to
                            more natural gorilla behaviors and closer encounters.</li>
                        <li><strong>Direct Interaction:</strong> With no competition for attention, you can have direct, meaningful interactions
                            with your guide, asking questions and learning more about gorilla conservation efforts.</li>
                        <li><strong>Flexibility in Timing:</strong> Easier to schedule at your convenience, possibly allowing for early morning
                            or late afternoon treks when animal activity might be higher.</li>
                        <li><strong>Personalized Conservation Contribution:</strong> Your solo trek fee might contribute more directly to
                            conservation efforts, as the costs are not spread among a larger group.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>2 People Trek</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Shared Exclusive Experience:</strong> Enjoy a more intimate experience with just one other person, allowing
                            for a quieter and more personal interaction with the gorillas.</li>
                        <li><strong>Customized Experience for Two:</strong> Tailor the trek to suit both participants' interests and pace,
                            providing flexibility in how you spend your time with the gorillas.</li>
                        <li><strong>Enhanced Safety and Companionship:</strong> Trekking with a partner provides companionship, making the
                            experience more enjoyable, while still maintaining a high level of safety due to the small group size.</li>
                        <li><strong>Quality Guide Interaction:</strong> With only two trekkers, your guide can offer personalized attention,
                            sharing detailed insights into gorilla behavior, conservation efforts, and the surrounding ecosystem.</li>
                        <li><strong>Reduced Environmental Impact:</strong> A trek with just two people still minimizes the environmental
                            footprint, contributing positively to conservation efforts.</li>
                        <li><strong>Photography Opportunities:</strong> Capture photos and videos with minimal interference, with your companion
                            possibly helping with shots or posing together in the wild setting.</li>
                        <li><strong>Quiet Observation:</strong> With fewer people, the trek remains quiet, which can lead to more natural
                            gorilla behavior and potentially closer encounters.</li>
                        <li><strong>Shared Learning Experience:</strong> Both participants can engage in direct, meaningful interactions with
                            the guide, enhancing the educational aspect by discussing and learning together about conservation.</li>
                        <li><strong>Flexibility in Timing:</strong> Scheduling is easier with just two, allowing for optimal timing based on
                            your mutual availability, possibly aligning with peak gorilla activity times.</li>
                        <li><strong>Conservation Contribution:</strong> Your shared trek fee still contributes significantly to gorilla
                            conservation, with the advantage of sharing the cost while maintaining the exclusivity of the experience.</li>

                    <h2>3 People Trek</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Small Group Intimacy:</strong> With just three participants, the experience remains intimate, allowing for a
                            close-knit group dynamic while still offering a personal encounter with the gorillas.</li>
                        <li><strong>Customized Group Experience:</strong> The trek can be tailored to the interests and physical abilities of
                            the three participants, ensuring everyone enjoys the experience at their preferred pace.</li>
                        <li><strong>Enhanced Safety with Companionship:</strong> A group of three provides safety in numbers with the added
                            benefit of companionship, making the trek more enjoyable and less intimidating.</li>
                        <li><strong>Personalized Guide Interaction:</strong> Your guide can still offer a high degree of personalized attention,
                            educating all three of you on gorilla behavior, conservation, and local ecology.</li>
                        <li><strong>Minimized Environmental Impact:</strong> Even with three people, the trek maintains a low environmental
                            impact, supporting conservation efforts by limiting human presence in the gorilla habitat.</li>
                        <li><strong>Collaborative Photography:</strong> With three people, you can take turns capturing photos or videos, or
                            assist each other in getting the best shots, enhancing the visual documentation of your adventure.</li>
                        <li><strong>Quiet Observation:</strong> The small group size ensures a quieter trek, which can lead to more natural
                            interactions with the gorillas and potentially closer encounters.</li>
                        <li><strong>Shared Learning Journey:</strong> The group can engage in discussions with the guide, enriching the
                            educational aspect by sharing insights and questions, fostering a collective learning environment.</li>
                        <li><strong>Flexible Scheduling:</strong> Scheduling for three is still relatively flexible, allowing the group to
                            choose times that might be optimal for gorilla viewing or align with everyone's availability.</li>
                        <li><strong>Conservation Contribution:</strong> The cost of the trek for three people is shared, yet each person's
                            contribution to conservation remains significant, with the added benefit of group camaraderie.</li>

                    <h2>3 is not a crowd Benefits</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Group Dynamics:</strong> Larger groups offer a vibrant social experience, enhancing camaraderie and shared
                            excitement during the trek.</li>
                        <li><strong>Shared Cost Efficiency:</strong> The cost per person can be lower when spread across more participants,
                            making the experience more affordable for each individual.</li>
                        <li><strong>Diverse Perspectives:</strong> With more people, you get a variety of perspectives and reactions, enriching

                        <li><strong>Environmental Education:</strong> Larger groups can be more impactful in spreading awareness about
                            conservation, as each member can become an ambassador for gorilla protection.</li>
                        <li><strong>Flexibility in Activities:</strong> With more participants, activities can be diversified; some might focus
                            on photography, others on learning, while some engage in quiet observation, providing a varied experience.</li>
                        <li><strong>Community Building:</strong> These treks can foster a sense of community among participants, especially if
                            they're part of an organized group or club, strengthening bonds through shared adventure.</li>
                        <li><strong>Conservation Contribution:</strong> While the environmental impact is slightly higher, the collective
                            contribution to conservation through trekking fees remains substantial, supporting broader conservation efforts.
